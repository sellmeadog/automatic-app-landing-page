# Changelog
Track what is changing with each release of Power 9. All new features and bug fixes are documented here.

### `Latest`

# Version 0.19.0

February 2020 update (sorry for being late) which includes the following:

### New Features

- Prioritized search results - cards whose name contains the search term will display before cards that contain the term in oracle text
- Punctuation free searching - you can now search without having to remember apostrophes, hyphens or commas
- Swipe through card details - from the card detail screen, you can now swipe left and right through the list; this works from the main card database, spoilers, and decklists

### Bug Fixes

- MTGO prices are available in the app again

<br>

### `Previous Versions`

# Version 0.18.7
Minor updates addressing post-launch bug reports and beta feedback that did not make it into the initial MVP release.

#### New Features
- No new features. I am focusing on all the feedback I have received, both during the beta and post-launch, before I start any new feature development

#### Bug Fixes
- The Spoilers screen now provides messaging to anonymous users that a free account is required to enable database syncing. Prior to this update, anonymous users would have seen a blank screen.
- Ads were added to the Spoiler screen. Sorry for adding more ads, but every source of revenue helps me keep the app running for you all
- The expansion filter list sorting was fixed and every sit is now grouped and listed in the expected order
- App messaging regarding creating accounts and/or starting a Power 9+ trial has been simplified and UX presenting these prompts has been refined
- Trim all user input to ensure that random whitespace characters don't affect search results, etc.

# Version 0.18.6
This is the first release of Power 9 on the App Store for iOS. 

#### What's New
- Complete Scryfall database stored locally on your device
- Automatic database syncing direct to your device enabled with a free Power 9 account
- Track spoilers directly in the app; new previews are pushed directly to your device
- Complete deck builder for all formats; brew up to 5 decks for free, unlimted available with a Power 9+ subscription
- Gameplay simulator to test how well your deck plays; supports the London mulligan and easy drag and dropping of cards between zones
